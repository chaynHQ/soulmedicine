        tag_line: What is Soul Medicine?
        description_html: <p>Soul Medicine is a multilingual digital service designed to deliver critical information in the form of easily digestible pieces through (Facebook Messenger and) email. These bits of information are designed by and for women experiencing abuse, especially migrant and refugee women.</p><p>Designed into courses divided into bite-sized lessons, you can access our resources from even a basic smartphone with internet connectivity. Currently, we cover topics ranging from legal information, financial advice to online safety, and even have tips to help you regain your confidence and how to deal with stress.</p>
      project_history:
        tag_line: Our History
        description_html: <h3>Information is Power</h3><p>In 2015, we wanted to design a project named “Happy Thoughts”. This project was going to deliver positive messages to people once in the morning and once before bed to uplift their spirits and to help them feel better. We even received funding from o2 Think Big and did an email trial. Guess what? Over 70% people thought these messages felt good.</p><p>As time went on, we tweaked our design a bit. Our research told that that many frontline organisations were suffering due to budget cuts, putting a lot of survivors at risk. Shelters were closing down, legal aid services were suffering and access to mental wellbeing resources were getting complicated. We realised if social organisations suffered, the information gap that we’re so worried about was only going to widen day by day.</p><p>And so, “Happy Thoughts” was reborn as Soul Medicine at the 2016 EmpowerHack hackathon! We wanted to build something that would help women make conscious decisions about their lives. How do we do this? Our collaboration in the Tech vs Abuse project told us that women were looking for information. And in all our learnings, one thing was clear - the right information could change lives.</p><p>That’s exactly what Soul Medicine is for. We’re here to give you important information bit by bit, day by day, that will help you understand the difficulties you are facing and help you tackle them - one day at a time.</p><p>This project is powered by everyone at Chayn. And to further develop Soul Medicine, we received a very important grant by Comic Relief and Big Lottery Fund that has made Soul Medicine into what it looks like today.</p><p>You can read more about all that helped us start on our research synthesis here <insert link when blog is published>.</p>
      design_principles:
        tag_line: Our Design Principles
        description_html: <h3>Safe. Accessible. Non-judgmental.</h3><p>Soul Medicine is designed to be safe, accessible, non-judgemental, intersectional and enabling.</p><h3>Safe</h3><p>The first step was to make sure our platform is ‘safe’ for our users. We’re designed for anonymity to be able to protect our users. Even our emails are disguised to shield you!</p><h3>Accessible</h3><p>Our users are likely to have limited internet access and little to no privacy. Soul Medicine does not need high-tech devices. You can access our work from a basic smartphone, on your email (or Facebook Messenger) - simple and accessible even at low bandwidth.</p><h3>Non-Judgemental</h3><p>People in situations of abuse are often ashamed and scared, and it is very important to offer help without judgement. And at Soul Medicine, we believe in the power of every woman.</p><h3>Intersectional</h3><p>We worked with survivors of abuse, migrant and refugee women from all backgrounds so that our solutions can be intersectional and applicable in as many countries as possible.</p><h3>Enabling</h3><p>Most importantly - we are designed to enable. We want to put you in the driver seat of your life, step by step. The end goal is to enable you to take small and meaningful actions that you can be proud of.</p><p>We know how difficult designing solutions like this can be. If you want to build something for survivors or want to learn more about our design principles, look no further. We wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/soul-medicine/how-to-reach-people-who-almost-no-one-is-reaching-fc91db019247">detailed blog</a> just for you!</p>
