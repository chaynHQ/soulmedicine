# How to Contribute to Chayn ‚≠ê

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute!

We ‚ù§Ô∏è our volunteers!

While Chayn is hybrid between paid staff and volunteers now, we cherish our volunteers for helping to create Chayn and keep us going! We hope to give back more than our contributors give. Please do not hesitate to give us feedback, so we can learn how to make this experience better for you. üòä You can include feedback in your pull request, GitHub issues / discussions, or [this anonymous form](https://forms.gle/17GQpeHc4G1Mgdf3A).

**This guide below assumes you are an open-source contributor and NOT an official Chayn volunteer that has already completed the onboarding process. If you would like to become an official tech volunteer with Chayn, please [visit our Getting Involved Guide](https://www.notion.so/chayn/Get-involved-423c067536f3426a88005de68f0cab19?pvs=4). As an official Chayn volunteer, you will receive professional onboarding onto our platforms and more opportunities to volunteer outside of GitHub contributions!**

Next, let's get started... üéâ

## New Contributor Guide

If you are new to GitHub and git version control, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

### What kind of contributions does Chayn want?

Chayn is open to all kinds of contributions, such as:

- no-code (improved documentation and translations)
- additional software tests
- code of any kind (enhancements and new features)

Just no spamming (such as unwanted, minor documentation and HTML/CSS changes) please!

## The Contribution Process:

1. **Read the README and Code of Conduct:** To get an overview of the project, please read the project's [README](/README.md). Contributing means you have agreed to our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

   **Note: If you are making no-code changes in the README or any other markdown / text files, it may not be required to follow all of these steps. Instead, you may edit these files and make your changes directly in GitHub and submit a PR without setting up the environment variables and without requiring tests to pass in your fork.**

2. **Create an issue or be assigned to an existing issue:**

   - If creating an issue, ensure that your issue doesn't already exist and to follow our issue templates. Please ask to be assigned your issue if you would like to work on it.

   - If you see an existing issue that interests you, please comment on it asking for the issue to be assigned to you. After the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it!

   - Issues can be assigned to multiple people if everyone agrees to collaborate!

   - Consider if an issue would be best broken up into multiple, smaller issues.

   - If an assigned issue is abandoned, we will unassign the issue. Please do not hestitate to comment on an issue you can no complete, we understand life happens. We will tag you when the issue is unassigned to you.

   - Be sure to scan our issue `labels` to find issues that suit you:

     - The `good first issue` label is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
     - The `moderate` label is for problems or updates that may take 1-2 days and will require some knowledge of the codebase.
     - The `advanced` is for problems or updates that may take more time, say around 2-4 days. These will require more in-depth knowledge of the codebase.

     - We suggest starting with a `good first issue` to get comfortable with the codebase before moving on.

   **Please feel free to ask clarifying questions in the issues discussions at any point during your contribution!**

3. **Fork the repo and create a new branch for your PR!**

    Please use a meaningful branch name, such as docs/add-social-links or feature/new-form. Look at the issue's labels for an idea on how to name your branch.

5. **Report progress and update your fork as needed:**

   - If your issue is more complex, feel free to report your progress by commenting on the issue or ticking off checkboxes in the issue description!
   - If the original base repo is updated, it is recommended that you sync your fork with the base repo in order to prevent merge conflicts.

6. **Commit and push your changes to your branch:**

   - Write brief comments explaining your code changes.
   - Keep commits small, remember a PR can have multiple commits!
   - Check that your tests pass. **Note: Some tests may need to be ran multiple times before they pass, thank you for your patience as we are upgrading our app's performance.**
   - Run our linters to ensure uniform code formatting.
   - Ensure that no secret tokens are being pushed to GitHub! Files containing secrets should be listed in `.gitignore`
   - Write a [meaningful commit message](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).

7. **Submit your PR:**

   - Make sure to link your corresponding issue in your PR's description!
   - Include detailed and concise explanations of the changes you made.
   - Include images in the description, if applicable.
   - Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so a maintainer can update the branch for a merge.
   - Be available for discussions that may arise and to make [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) that may be required before merging.
